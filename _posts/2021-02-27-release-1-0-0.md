First stable version of Glimpse has been released.

As the development of version 1.1.0 starts, focus will now shift to
making existing features more “complete”.

Version 1.1.0 backlog includes:
*  different types of meshes (points, lines, quads, etc.),
*  indexed meshes,
*  full-screen mode (Desktop),
*  handling mouse/touch events in multiplatform projects,
*  improvements to [documentation](/documentation/) and
   [tutorials](/tutorials/).
