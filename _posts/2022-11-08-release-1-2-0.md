Version 1.2.0 has been released.

### Major Changes In v1.2.0 API

#### Core

- `@Uniform` can no longer be used to annotate properties of type `Texture`
  _(`@Sampler2D` should be used instead)_
- New `@Sampler2D` annotation that can be used to annotate shader parameters
  properties of types:
  - `Texture`
  - `Array<Texture>`
  - `Iterable<Texture>`
- Added properties `width` and `height` in `TextureImageSource` and `Texture`
- Usage of method `ProgramExecutor.dispose()` without parameters will be
  reported as an error

#### HUD

- Implemented utilities for rendering HUD-style 2D elements on top of 3D scene

#### Annotation Processor

- Kapt processors (`glimpse-processor-java` and `glimpse-processor-kotlin`) have
  been removed. _Use KSP processor instead (`glimpse-processor-ksp`)_
